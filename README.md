## Milestone3.py: Fine-Tuning Summary

The file `Milestone3.py` contains the process used to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model specifically for career guidance.

### Summary of the Fine-Tuning Process:

**Data Preparation:**

   * Converted the career guidance dataset from JSON to JSONL format.
   * Structured data into prompt-completion pairs for training.

**Fine-Tuning the Model:**

   * Uploaded the formatted dataset to OpenAI using the API.
   * Fine-tuned the GPT-3.5 model to generate career advice based on user queries.

**Model Usage:**

   * Loaded the fine-tuned model in the Streamlit app to respond to career-related questions.

**Note:**

* The fine-tuning process was completed separately, and the chatbot directly uses the resulting model.
* You do not need to repeat the fine-tuning process to use the chatbot.
* The `Milestone3.py` script is shared for reference and documentation purposes.

## Future Enhancements

* **Enhanced Personalization:** Incorporate user profiles for more tailored advice.
* **Industry-Specific Modules:** Add more targeted advice for different career fields.
* **Platform Integration:** Connect with LinkedIn for job suggestions and resume insights.
